# A gRPC API vulnerable app

For testing hawkscan GRPC and protobuf capabilities.

‚ÄºÔ∏è**NOTE** ‚ÄºÔ∏è
**There are no vulnerabilities in this project yet** only a basic gRPC service 
springboot setup. 

Things to be added
1. Postgresql backend for the [ItemsService](src/main/kotlin/hawk/grpckt/ItemsService.kt)
2. docker-compose setup for build and running the postgres DB
3. Add a Search method to the ItemService with and SQLi vulnerability.

```

### Spring run
```shell

```

## Testing

See [GrpcProxyClientTest.kt](src/test/kotlin/hawk/test/GrpcProxyClientTest.kt)
